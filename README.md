# ðŸ“Š MATLAB Codes & Visualizations

This repository contains my collection of **MATLAB programs and visualizations**, covering a variety of concepts in signal processing, control systems, mathematics, and general simulations. Each script is accompanied by **graphical outputs** (plots/figures) for better understanding of the underlying concepts.

Iâ€™ll keep updating this repository with my future MATLAB progress. ðŸš€

---

## ðŸ”¹ What youâ€™ll find here
- Implementation of **basic and advanced MATLAB scripts**
- **Signal plots** (unit step, impulse, ramp, exponential, sine, cosine, etc.)
- **System response visualizations** (time-domain & frequency-domain)
- Organized, well-documented code with comments

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repo is intended as a **learning resource** for students, beginners, and enthusiasts who want to explore MATLAB coding along with visual demonstrations of theoretical concepts.

---

## ðŸš€ How to use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.m` files in MATLAB or GNU Octave.
3. Run the scripts to view plots and results.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ExTc-aShiSh/MATLAB.git
