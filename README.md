# MATLAB
This repository contains my collection of MATLAB programs and visualizations, covering a variety of concepts in signal processing, control systems, mathematics, and general simulations. Each code snippet is accompanied by graphical outputs (plots/figures) for better understanding of the underlying concepts.
